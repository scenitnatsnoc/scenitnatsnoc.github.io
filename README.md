# Self-Introduction

I have been in the Computer Science program for three years, starting in 2022 at SNHU. I chose CS because I was amazed by the rapid development of machine learning and AI, and I wanted to understand how it works while learning various programming languages.

While in the program, I have learned how to write software from zero to production. By understanding the problem to be solved and the various use cases, determining the appropriate technology, tools, and programming languages for each case, and using pseudocode and a flowchart to visualize the process more clearly.  I learned about different design patterns and which to use in various scenarios.  Another important skill I gained is how to use MEAN to build a full-stack application and migrate it to the Cloud by re-engineering it for a serverless architecture. 

With my ePortfolio, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in multiple programming languages by porting one of my applications from Java to Python. Another skill I would like to present is the ability to visualize data using the Python Dash library, which enables the creation of multiple graphs and dashboards. I also wanted to showcase my knowledge of algorithms and data structures by optimizing the sorting function from my previous courses and adding additional modules to enhance its functionality.

Being proficient in multiple programming languages and design patterns, and knowing when to use them for different use cases, makes me a stronger candidate for software engineering positions, which is a specialization I am targeting.

# Code Review

Above is the code review for each of the following categories:
+	Software design and engineering 
+	Algorithms and data structures 
+	Databases

## Software design and engineering
For my Artifact in the Software Engineering and Design category, I chose to enhance one of the applications I developed in Java during my previous course, IT-145: Java Programming. We were tasked with developing a Java software application for the fictitious company Grazioso Salvare to help track search-and-rescue animals. These search-and-rescue animals are obtained and trained by the company to rescue humans from life-threatening situations. The required functionality of the application was to intake animals, reserve animals, and print available animals to the user's console. My enhancements for this artifact include porting it to Python, adding a SQLite database for persistent storage, and implementing login functionality with secure credential storage.

## Algorithms and data structure
For my Artifact in the Algorithms and data structure category, I chose to enhance one of the applications in one of the previous assignments at Study.com during the Computer Science 201 - Data Structures & Algorithms course, we were tasked with developing a Java application that sorts an unsorted list of States and Capitals in natural order (alphabetical), either by State or by Capital. Additionally, we needed to create a HashMap (to demonstrate that it does not guarantee the order) and a TreeMap (to show that it sorts in natural order by default) of States and capitals. Finally, a Trivia Game to test knowledge of states and their capitals needed to be implemented, along with a single question/answer module to determine the capital of a particular state.

## Databases
For my Artifact in the Algorithms and data structure category, I chose to visualize data from the DAD-220 course by creating a database, importing the data, migrating it to MongoDB, and using Python DASH dashboards and graphs to analyze the companyâ€™s performance.
